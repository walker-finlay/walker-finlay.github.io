### Testing out features

This post and all following will be rendered from **markdown** to html using gatsby. Markdown makes for easy and painless post writing. On top of that, [`gatsby-remark-katex`](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-remark-katex/?=gatsby-remark-) can render nice looking equations written in **LaTeX** in inline mode e.g. $\sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac{1}{n}$ or display mode e.g.

$$
P(A\vert B)=\frac{P(B\vert A)P(A)}{P(B)}
$$

To make the posts interactive, they will include **React components via mdx**. Below is a small example of a React component [^1] directly in a markdown file. 

<LiveClock />

And here's an external link to [Google](https://google.com). Now let me try out extended [^2] **syntax highlighting with prismjs**:

```ipython{numberLines: true}
>>> sq = (x**2 for x in range(10))
>>> list(sq)
[0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81]
>>> 
```

Finally, the empty html tags at the beginning and end of (most) pages on this site are coding themed **content delimiters**, which also serve as top and bottom scroll buttons. Clicking the opening and closing tags will take you smoothly to the bottom and top of the page, respectively.

More to come soon!

[^2]: Prism does not include interactive Python, so I extended the Python grammar to include the iPython prompt (`>>>`) and made it unselectable in markdown code blocks.
