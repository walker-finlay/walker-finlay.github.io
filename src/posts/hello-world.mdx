# Hello World!

### Testing out features

This post and all following will be rendered from **markdown** to html using gatsby. Markdown makes for easy and painless post writing. On top of that, [`gatsby-remark-katex`](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-remark-katex/?=gatsby-remark-) can render nice looking equations written in **LaTeX** in inline mode e.g. $\sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac{1}{n}$ or display mode e.g.

$$
P(A\vert B)=\frac{P(B\vert A)P(A)}{P(B)}
$$

To make the posts interactive, they will include React components using **mdx**. Below is a small example of a React component directly in an mdx file from [`react-clock`](https://github.com/wojtekmaj/react-clock).

<LiveClock />

And here's an external link to [Google](https://google.com). Now let me try out syntax highlighting:

```python
sq = [x**2 for x in range(10)]
```
