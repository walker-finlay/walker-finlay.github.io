# Hello World!

### Testing out features

This post and all following will be rendered from **markdown** to html using gatsby for easy and painless post writing. On top of that, [`gatsby-remark-katex`](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-remark-katex/?=gatsby-remark-) can render nice looking equations from **LaTeX** format in inline mode $\sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac{1}{n}$ (harmonic series) or display mode:

$$
P(A\vert B)=\frac{P(B\vert A)P(A)}{P(B)}
$$

(Bayes Theorem). To make the posts interactive, they will include React components using **mdx**. Below is a small example of a React component directly in an mdx file from [`react-clock`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-clock).
