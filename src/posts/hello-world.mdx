### Testing out features

This post and all following will be rendered from **markdown** to html using gatsby. Markdown makes for easy and painless post writing. On top of that, [`gatsby-remark-katex`](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-remark-katex/?=gatsby-remark-) can render nice looking equations written in **LaTeX** in inline mode e.g. $\sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac{1}{n}$ or display mode e.g.

$$
P(A\vert B)=\frac{P(B\vert A)P(A)}{P(B)}
$$

To make the posts interactive, they will include **React components via mdx**. Below is a small example of a React component [^1] directly in a markdown file. 

<LiveClock />

And here's an external link to [Google](https://google.com). Now let me try out extended [^2] **syntax highlighting with prismjs**:

```ipython{numberLines: true}
>>> sq = (x**2 for x in range(10))
>>> list(sq)
[0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81]
>>> 
```

Hopefully more to come!

[^2]: Prism does not include interactive Python, so I extended the Python grammar to include the iPython prompt (`>>>`) and made it unselectable in markdown code blocks.
