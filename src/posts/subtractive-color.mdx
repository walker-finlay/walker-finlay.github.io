This mini-project, a variation of which lives in the header bar, was inspired by [Felipe Pantone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felipe_Pantone)'s [Subtractive Variability](https://www.felipepantone.com/subtractive-variability) series. Felipe Pantone is an Argentine-Spanish artist known for his “use of bold colors, geometrical patterns and Op Art elements”.[^1] His Subtractive Variability series derives such bold colors from the fundamentals of color theory. 

## Color Theory
Within color theory, color can be classified in one of four ways:

1. Warm and Cold
2. Receding and Advancing
3. Positive and negative
4. Subtractive and additive

Subtractive and additive refer to two models we use to conceptualize color sources, and how colors are mixed on their way to our eye, depending on the model.

#### Subtractive Color 
In the subtractive model, white light hits an object, and certain wavelengths are "subtracted" or absorbed, reflecting only the wavelength(s) which we ultimately assign to that object.

#### Additive Color
If the baseline in subtractive color is white light, something from which to subtract, the baseline in additive color is blackness/absence of light, something to add to. Additive color is modeled as a mix of color emitted from different light sources, each with their own color. 

Web designers use additive color all the time via the rgb color model, because computer and tv pixels emit varying levels of red, blue, and green light.
